Xen-Admin is a clone of Xen Orchestra's web based management tool without the subscription, upsells and nagging.  It is a completely free 

Why make Xen-Admin?
Since XCP-ng (Vates) no longer supports the XenServer management UI project (xcp-admin), the only remaining option to manage your XCP-ng environment is with their XOA product which is chock full of upsells, adverts, subscription nudges, and other FUD.
If you wish to avoid that, and make the XO tool on your own, the process is difficult and poorly documented.
Enter Xen-Admin.
This fork is simply a clutter and anxiety free version which includes the full functionally for free.
